#  Tyre Picker

This repo is a challenge I set myself to create a filterable list. <br />
I am able to discuss any questions you may have. <br />
The app is able to fetch from a mongodb database using a nodeJS API, the API allows for searching for sizes and names of certain tyres as well as paginating the results into pages of 3.  <br />
The frontend for the webapp is using Component-based React! <br />
Enjoy!
